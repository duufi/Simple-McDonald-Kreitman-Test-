### MK test master will perform the MK calculation on every lin ein the file regardless of frequency values in the population
### Best part of this program is that it is a function as opposed to lines of code, allowing for an input statement and an
### MK calculation based off of the specified file

import math
import csv

### function will run with the file name as an input parameter, specified in main function
