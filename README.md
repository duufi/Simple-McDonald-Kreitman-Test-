This repository provides scripts that allows users to perform McDonald-Kreitman test calculations on SNP dataset.  

mk_test_master contains an algorithm for calculating rates of adaptation (alpha) for all alleles present in a population (or alleles present in input dataset)

mk_test_5_up contains an algorithm for calculating rates of adaptation (alpha) for all alleles present in the population (or input dataset) at frequencies above .5000
